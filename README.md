2.  In the terminal window type the following to create the new database.

```
    createdb project3_db
```

## **SETTING UP THE CLOUDINARY**
---
- Create an account on cloudinary
- copy the api, cloud name and access token into your .env file.

```
CLOUD_KEY=
CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUD_SECRET=
```

- 'npm install fs' for file access. This is used to remove the temporary file of the server once completed the upload t ocloudinary.
- The dependancy 'express-fileupload' was also installed to handle the file uploads at the server side. Uploaded files are stored in a temporary folder. You will have to write the code to delete these temporary files. use 'file.upload.tempFilePath' to locate the path of the temp file.

```
const file = req.files;
fs.unlinkSync(file.upload.tempFilePath);
```
